This is a list of planned projects for beetle vision.

TODO : dcGAN
  Use the dcgan repo on github to see what comes out
TODO : saliency map
  Create saliency maps from a classifier (maybe pytorch?). Interested to see if it puts heat on things like attenae especially
TODO : unsupervised learning
  Use the MLforArtists notebook to obtain activations in the VGG16 trained on imagenet data to do clustering of the beetle images.
TODO : Autoencoder
  Figure out how to write this from scratch, with color images of any size.
TODO : Classifier
  Create a classifier in Keras from scratch without transfer learning.
